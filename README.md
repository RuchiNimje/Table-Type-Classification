Time to solve the problem: Approx 9  hours 

Solution explanation: Used a pre-trained VGG16 model, fine-tuned on the provided dataset. The model was trained to classify images into the specified categories.

Model used and reason: VGG16 was used because it is a powerful pre-trained model for image classification tasks, and fine-tuning it on our dataset helps achieve good performance with limited data.

Shortcomings and improvement:The model might be overfitting to the training data due to the small dataset size. Data augmentation and more diverse training data can help improve performance.

Model performance on test data: Report classification metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Future Scope for the Project
Data Augmentation:
Increase the diversity of the training dataset using data augmentation techniques like rotations, translations, and flips. This helps the model generalize better.
Transfer Learning:
Use other pre-trained models like ResNet, Inception, or EfficientNet and fine-tune them for this specific task. Different models may offer better performance for different data types.
Ensemble Methods:
Combine predictions from multiple models (ensemble learning) to improve overall performance and reduce the likelihood of overfitting.
Hyperparameter Tuning:
Experiment with different hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, and architecture layers. Techniques like grid search or random search can help in finding the optimal hyperparameters.
Advanced Optimization Techniques:
Implement optimization algorithms like AdamW, Nadam, or learning rate schedules to improve convergence and model performance.
Regularization Techniques:
Use regularization methods like dropout, L1/L2 regularization, or batch normalization to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.
Increase Training Data:
Gather more labeled data to train the model. More data generally helps improve model performance, especially for deep learning models.
Model Interpretability:
Implement techniques like Grad-CAM to visualize which parts of the images the model focuses on during classification. This can help in understanding model behavior and improving trust in the model.
Optimization Techniques:
Model Pruning:
Remove redundant weights in the network to reduce model size and inference time without significantly affecting accuracy.
Quantization:
Convert the model weights from floating-point precision to lower precision (e.g., INT8) to reduce model size and increase inference speed, particularly useful for deployment on edge devices.
Knowledge Distillation:
Use a larger, well-trained model to train a smaller model. This helps in deploying models on resource-constrained environments without significant loss of accuracy.
Batch Normalization:
Use batch normalization to accelerate training and improve model stability by normalizing the inputs of each layer.
Early Stopping and Checkpointing:
Use early stopping to halt training when the model's performance on a validation set stops improving. Checkpointing can save the best model during training.
Learning Rate Scheduling:
Implement learning rate schedulers that adjust the learning rate during training, which can help in converging faster and potentially reaching better performance.
